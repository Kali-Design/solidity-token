/* I pasted the key 0x2C308a229a537802fe9411F684930F2A205B6295 in "At address" in Remix.etherum in 
"injected Web3" environment with my metamask connected to rinkeby. Then create a file named "code" 
and copy and paste the Solidity code for exercise. Clicked on "deployed" and a string_ExoLink 
appeared and copied the link https://github.com/AbsoluteVirtueXI/alyra-courses/blob/master/res/Png.md
